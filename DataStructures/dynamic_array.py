'''
an array that can change in size.
takes up a countinues chunk of memory
can be referenced numerically (list[i])
terminology:
size - real size of the array
length - size that the user gave

the logic behind the dynamic array is if it reaches its maximal length
we copy it and double the size.

complexity:
appending/popping a node at the end O(1)
adding a node in the beginning O(n)
